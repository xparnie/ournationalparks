                                <p>I drove overnight to get as close to sunrise as possible. The park itself was just beautiful and covered in green; which was unexpected due to it being part of the badlands. It is a smaller park, one you can just drive around in a few hours and get what it’s all about. Initially, you are greeted with fields of prairie dogs on both sides of the road.</p>
                                <p>A theme with parks is road closures and this isn’t an exception. Luckily, the park is not busy and you’re still able to navigate around without issue. The road was about to end,  I look up and see this horse on top of a hill. A photo gift from the gods. It was still pretty far away and didn’t have a long enough lens, but it was nice to capture the mustang as well as the green of the park (it’s almost fairytale-like). </p>
                                <p>It was difficult to get the horse at the right angle. I would run up a hill and he would turn, run back down he would turn like he was just messing with me. The straight-on shot ended up working out and I think turned out great.</p>
                                <p>If you zoom in on the horse, it is almost like it’s wearing a mask (straight out of Hyrule). Picture below.</p>

                                <p>I used this park as a stop on my way to Yellowstone/Grand Tetons, but it really deserved more time than that. There are two separate units of the park, this was the south unit. The north unit is a bit of a drive away and off the path that I was on. </p>

                                <p>It really proved that no matter the size of the park or its location, it’s a park for a reason and deserves your time.</p>

                                <p>Traffic. Construction. People.</p>

                                <p>Expect all of those things when you’re going through Yellowstone. It can be frustrating at times, but then you turn the corner and see a massive bison in a stream. It makes up for all that.</p>

                                <p>I was looking for wildlife pictures throughout the day. There are a ton of bison in the park, but most of clustered in the middle of a pasture away from the roads. It’s definitely not a good idea to approach them in any capacity.</p>

                                <p>I pulled over to use the restroom and when I got out I saw this bison about to cross the stream. At first, he was drinking the water out of the right edge and was unsure what he was going to do. He began to cross and started to take a few shots. Looking back, my camera settings for this were not the best. I would prefer a slightly lower ISO, for qualities sake, and possibly bump the aperture to f/16. I do think the shot turned out well enough though; keeping most everything in focus.</p>

                                <p>It was a rather bright, sun-shinin’ day out. I normally like to shoot for the sky, but wasn’t really thinking at the time. When I say that I mean that I drop the exposure in order to get the sky in detail. Camera’s these days are able to gather detail even in the low light areas, but if you get the sky too bright you end up squandering all that detail. It is a hard thing to think about when shooting wildlife though. You don’t know what the animal is doing or where you need to be exactly to get the shot.</p>

                                <p>I do all of my editing in Lightroom. In the shot, since the lighting in the wild is something you can’t control, the sky is slightly blown out and the bison is hidden in the shadows. Luckily, it’s rather simple to change that. As long as you have the right angle, you can usually recover in post.</p>

                                <div className="post-img">
                                    <img src="../images/original-wading-buffalo.jpg" alt="original wading buffalo" />
                                </div>

                                <p>The optimal shot would have been to tell the bison to stop in the middle of the stream, get my tripod, and take an HDR shot (exposure: +2, 0, -2), but that’s really not in the cards. To gather all the detail of the sky, middle, and foreground.</p>

                                <p>There are some situations you just have to trust the technology you have and visualize how it could look instead of how it looks right off the camera. When I’m taking a picture I’m thinking of how Lightroom will be able to manage certain spots. It’s really quite a bit to think about.</p>
